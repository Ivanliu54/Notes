# AI in financial services

*  to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud. The insights can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade. Data mining can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cybersurveillance to pinpoint warning signs of fraud.

**Emerj is an artificial intelligence market research firm. We help companies and institutions gain insight on the applications and implications of AI and machine**

# AI in government

* Government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights. Analyzing sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money. Machine learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft.

# AI in health care

Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time. The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment.

# Marketing and sales

Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyze your buying history – and promote other items you'd be interested in. This ability to capture data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience (or implement a marketing campaign) is the future of retail.

# Oil and gas

Finding new energy sources. Analyzing minerals in the ground. Predicting refinery sensor failure. Streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective. The number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast – and still expanding.

# Transportation

Analyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability. The data analysis and modeling aspects of machine learning are important tools to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations.

Siemens

The German conglomerate Siemens has been using neural networks to monitor its steel plants and improve efficiencies for decades. The company claims that this practical experience has given it a leg up in developing AI for manufacturing and industrial applications. In addition, the company claims to have invested around $10 billion in US software companies (via acquisitions) over the past decade.

In March of 2016 Siemens launched Mindsphere (in beta), which is a main competitor to GE’s Predix product. Mindsphere – which Siemens describes as a smart cloud for industry – allows machine manufacturers to monitor machine fleets for service purposes throughout the world. At the end of 2016 it also integrated IBM’s Watson Analytics into the tools offered by their service.

Like GE, Siemens aims to monitor, record, and analyze everything in manufacturing from design to delivery to find problems and solutions that people might not even know exist. The German government has referred to this general dynamic of “Industry 4.0.”

The AI success story Siemens frequently highlights is how it has improved specific gas turbines’ emissions better than any human was able to. “Even after experts had done their best to optimize the turbine’s nitrous oxide emissions,” says Dr. Norbert Gaus, Head of Research in Digitalization and Automation at Siemens Corporate Technology, “our AI system was able to reduce emissions by an additional ten to fifteen percent.”

Siemens latest gas turbines have over 500 sensors that continuously temperature, pressure, stress, and other variables. All this information is feed to their neural network-based AI. Siemens claims their system is learning how to continuously adjust fuel valves to create the optimal conditions for combustion based on specific weather conditions and the current state of the equipment. More combustion results in few unwanted by-products.
